# The Extensible PI Cluster Frame  
This repository contains all the files for the The Extensible PI Cluster Frame  or **EPIC Frame**  

This cluster frame provides:

* Easy way if extending the frame
* Easy way of inserting / removing PI nodes from the cluster frame
* Each node can have proper cooling, by able to place heat-sinks on the PI nodes. 
* A special developed PI Cluster HAT provides addition cooling by PWM controlled FAN 
* A special developed PI Cluster HAT provides signal distribution across a backplane (Power 3.3V,5V,I2C)
* A special developed backplane provides power and signal (I2C) to each node
* A special developed LED board provides 3 RGB LED per node for status
* A special developed Power board provides the interface to the backplane 
* The cluster frame is extensible. The smallest frame consist of two nodes, and can be extended by 2 nodes (2,4,8,10)
* A Frame of 10 PI nodes fits into a 19" rack.

This cluster frame needs an external power supply. See the documentation directory for more information about power requirements.

This repository contains all the files to create the Cluster frame and PCB's. See the docs directory for more information and installation instructions.
In the tools directory you find tools which may be handy during assembly.

Note that:

**Current this project is in active development** 
which means that:

The design is still changing, and there are still changes being made. 

If you however want to help, and test things out or just want to give feedback:

Then **YES** put your 3D printer to work and test out the design!
