This repository contains all the files for the **EPIC Frame**  (Which stand for: Extensible PI Cluster Frame)

See the docs directory for more information and installation instructions.

WARNING:

** Current this project is in active development which means that: **

The design is still changing, and there are still a couple of problems.

So at this stage it's **NOT** recommended to 3D print, and build this project.

If you however want to help, and test things out or just want to give feedback:

Then **YES** put your 3D printer to work and test out the design!
