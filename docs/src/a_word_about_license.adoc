=== A word about license
This Frame cluster and PCB's are free to everyone to use share and alter. Since I use closed source programs, like Fusion 360, Diptrace (for schematic, and PCB's) I cannot call this true open hardware. Therefore this PI Cluster Frame is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license.
