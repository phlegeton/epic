The PI Cluster HAT PCB contains SMD parts and also Through Hole parts. It may require some skills to solder these SMD parts, but it shouldn't be too hard to do, since the SMD package size is rather large (SOT-23-3 and 0805). 

Per PCB you need: 

- 9x SDM 0805 330 Ohm resistor (R2 - R10)
- 2x SMD 0805 3.9K Ohm resistor (R12,R13)
- 1x SMD 0805 1K Ohm resistor (R11)
- 1x SMD 0805 100nF capacitor (C1)
- 1x BAS 16 diode (might not required)
- 1x 2 Amp SMD 1206 fuse 63V 2A Slow blow
- 1x CAT 24c32 EEProm (not required)
- 1x NDS351N MOSFET (SMD sot-23-3) 
- 1x 40 pins GPIO header
- 1x 6 pins box header (for the I2C breakout connector). (not required)
- 1x 2 pins 2.54 male connector to program the EEPROM (However this also can be a piece of solid wire, so below)
- 1x 2 pins 2.54 female jumper (However if a wire link is used, not needed)

Depending on how you connect everything to the PI Cluster HAT:

- Solder the wires directly onto the PCB
- Use connectors

When using connectors you need the following:

- 1x 10 pins JST XH 90 degree angle PCB connector
- 2x 2 pins JST XH 90 degree angle PCB connector

NOTE: These connectors are often called "JST XH 2.54". However the pitch is really 2.5. This is normally not a problem, and fits in a 2.54 pitch.

The pro of soldering the wires directly to the PCB is the low profile. The downside is of course that when removing or when needing to replace a part, the wires needs to be de-soldered. 

When using connectors, all the connections can easily be disconnected. Which makes maintenance much easier. However, it costs more.

Whichever solution you choose, it doesn't matter, as long as the profile of the PCB is as low as possible. As a guideline: nothing should stick out above the FAN. When using for example straight connectors, the profile get to high, and the PI tray won't be able to slide in or out of the PI Cluster Frame. 

=== Enable EEPROM write mode
To be able to program the EEPROM, the EEPROM must be writeable. To do this the pins on J6 ('WR-E') must be shorted. This can be done by soldering a 2 pins 2.54 male connector. Or simply by soldering a wire link. 

To pro of using two pins 2.54 male connector is that it's easy to place a jumper across the pins, which is easily be removed once programming of the EEPRON is done. However the 2 pins are somewhat in the way of the FAN connector, making it a bit trickier to connect the FAN. 

By using a wire link, the pro is that the FAN is easy to connect, however, once the link is cut, it might be more difficult to short the link again, to reprogram the EEPROM.

=== Soldering the PCB
When starting to solder the PCB, first start with the SMD components:

Next solder the JST XH 2.54 haeders onto the PCB

As a last step solder the 6 pins 2.54mm header, and then the as the last component the 2x20 GPIO pin header at the other side of the PCB. 

Tip for soldering the GPIO header: To make sure soldering the header straight, to PI Cluster HAT can be temporarily mounted onto a Raspberry PI, using the plastic mount stand-offs.   

The final PCB is shown below. In a last step the FLUX must be cleaned up from the PCB. But apart from that, this is how the finished PCB should look like.
