The assembly of the LED Board is perhaps the most tricky one. Since space on the LED Board is quite limited, the footprint of the RGB LED's are somewhat "spaced close together". You get this when trying to solder the RGB LED's, without trying to bridge the pins together. 

To assemble the LED Board, the following is needed:

- 1x LED board
- 3x RGB LED
- 1x Solder helper tool (Trust me, you really want to 3D print this tool and actually use it)
- 1x complete cable with 2x (pre) crimped JST XH 10 pins 2.54 female connector
- 1x 10 pins JST XH connector

=== Placing the RGB LED's
The first and most important thing is to insert the RGB LED's in the right orientation. The next image is demonstrating this:

Another way of looking at this is: On the PCB the LED markings have an open spot, the flat side of the RGB should be at this opening:

After determine the right orientation of the RGB LED's insert them into the LED board:

=== Using the soldering helper tool

Add this point, you should have 3D printed the solder helper tool. Place the LED Board PCB as follows in the solder helper tool:

NOTE: To align the RGB flat with the PCB, there is only one way of inserting the PCB correctly into the solder helper tool

As you can see from the picture, it may help to cut the RGB LED's legs short, to make soldering even easier.

Once the PCB is inserted correctly, and the RGB LED's are flat with the PCB surface, solder all the legs of the RGB LED's without bridging them. 

TIP: To prevent bridging, use 0.5mm tin. And if pins are bridge, cut the legs short as possible and use solder wick to suck away the tin.

Solder the JST XH connector to the LED Board as follows:

Once the Connector is soldered, attach the cable:

=== Testing the LED Board

Once the RGB LED's and wires are soldered, the LED Board can be tested if you have a 5V power supply (for example a LAB Power supply)

On the LED Board the GND pin is marked. Stick a wire which is thick enough into the correct hole in the connector, which aligns with the GND pin. You can use a Multimeter and it's continuity tester to verify this. Connect the GND wire to a lab power supply. Next use a 330Ohm resistor, and use for example crocodile clip to hold the resistor. Connect the other end to the plus of the power supply and supply 5V with low Amperes ( around 20mA) 

Insert the resistor into the hole next to the GND and should see a color light up, move the resistor to the next hole, and another color should light up. Repeat this process for all the RGB LED's. If all the three RGB LED's are working, the assembly of the LED Board is completed.
