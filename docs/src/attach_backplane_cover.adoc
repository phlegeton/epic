=== Attaching the backplane cover
If the cluster frame is able to power all the PI nodes, the back-plane covers can be placed.

To attach the back-plane cover you need: 

- 1x XT60 connector 
- 2x M2.5x10
- For every back-plane you need one cover
- For every back-plane cover you need 4x M3x30 screw

=== Prepare the back-plane cover
One of the back-plane cover is holding the XT60 connector, so there is one 5V connection which powers the whole PI cluster:

To attach the XT60 connector insert the XT60 connector from the back:

Next insert the 2xM2.5x10 screws from the top:

=== Power connections
The backplane cover connects the power to the whole PI Cluster. So a cable is needed to connect the SMPS to the backplane. And from the XT60 connectors connections need to be made to the back-plane(s). See the discussion in the section <<Connecting the backplane>> about how to connect the back-plane(s)

=== Placing the back-plan covers
To place the the cover make sure all the PI nodes are powered off. And no 5V is applied to the chassis.

The easiest way to place the backplane covers is to place the cover, back-plane by back-plane: 

- Unscrew the four temporarily screws
- Place the backplane cover
- Use 4x M3x30 screws to fasten the backplane cover

Repeat this for every back-plane
