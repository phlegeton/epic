= Building cluster frame

== Building the frame 

Written by {firstname}

To build 1 cluster frame, the following is needed:

- 1x backplate
- 1x front-plate
- 1x connecting rod left
- 1x connecting rod right
- 1x back-plane shim (more on that later on)
- 1x back-plane PCB
- 6x Brass press insert M3
- 2x M3x10
- 2x M3x25

The first step is to 3D print all the parts. When building a frame for 10 nodes this is a process that can take several days to complete. It's also possible to print the parts for 2 nodes (so one frame at the time). And extend the frame in the course of a few days. 

The 3D printed parts needed are shown in the picture below:

The attribute fullWidth is set to {fullWidth}

NOTE: During development a back-plane shim is used. This will no longer be needed in production.

Before starting the assembly, make sure to deburr all the edges. Next place the brass press inserts into both sides of the connecting rods and use a hot conical tip from a soldering iron the gently press the inserts into the hole. Make sure that the insert is level with the surface. So that the insert isn't sticking out, and make sure don't press the insert to deep. 

Also make sure that the press insert is inserted straight. Inserting the press insert on a slightly angle will cause the frame to be out of alignment. 

Once the insert are pressed in, press the two remaining inserts into the top holes of the front plate.
