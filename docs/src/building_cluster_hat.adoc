The PI Cluster HAT PCB contains SMD parts and also Through Hole parts. It may require some skills to solder these SMD parts, but it shouldn't be too hard to do, since the SMD package size is rather large (SOT-23-3 and 0805). 

Per PCB you need: 

- 9x SDM 0805 330 Ohm resistor
- 2x SMD 0805 3.9K Ohm resistor
- 1x SMD 0805 1K Ohm resistor
- 1x 2 Amp SMD 1206 fuse 63V 2A Slow blow
- 1x CAT 24c32 EEProm
- 1x NDS351N MOSFET (SMD sot-23-3) 
- 2x 10 pins JST XH cable connectors (these are available already crimped to a cable)

Depending on how you connect everything to the PI Cluster HAT:

- Solder the wires directly onto the PCB
- Use connectors

When using connectors you need the following:

- 1x 40 pins GPIO header
- 1x  10 pins JST XH 90 degree angle PCB connector
- 2x 2 pins JST XH 90 degree angle PCB connector
- 1x 6 pins box header


The pro of soldering the wires directly to the PCB is the low profile. The downside is of course that when removing or when needing to replace a part, the wires needs to be de-soldered. 

When using connectors, all the connections can easily be disconnected. Which makes maintenance much easier. However, it costs more.

Whichever solution you choose, it doesn't matter, as long as the profile of the PCB is as low as possible.

=== Soldering the PCB
When starting to solder the PCB, first start with the SMD components:

Next solder the JST XH 2.54 haeders onto the PCB

As a last step solder the 6 pins 2.54mm header, and then the as the last component the 2x20 GPIO pin header at the other side of the PCB. The final PCB is shown below. In a last step the FLUX must be cleaned up from the PCB. But apart from that, this is how the finished PCB should look like.

NOTE: During development, the PCB version 2.0 (Hades Edition) a few bodge wires where needed, to let the MOSFET do it's work. Also note that the test points are shorted together, allowing the EEPROM te be written. 

When soldering the PCB start with the smallest componets. So first solder the resistors, the and the other SMD components. Next solder the connectors (if you choose to use connectors). Solder the 2x20 GPIO header as last part. Make sure the GPIO header is straight, and in a 90 degree angle to the board.
