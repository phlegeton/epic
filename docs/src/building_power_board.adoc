== Building the PowerBoard
Materials needed:

- 1x Power Board PCB
- 2x 2x3 female 2.54 pitch connectors
- 1x JST XH 254 connector
- 1x Black wire 
- 1x Red wire
- 2x JST crimp connectors
- 1x Connector template
- 1x Crimp tool the crimp the JST XH 2.54 connector

NOTE: The JST XT 2.54 connectors can be bought pre-crimped. However the copper pairs, or most likely to be very thin, causing a severe power drop.

TIP: Before assembly make sure to print the alignment tool from the extra folder. This tools helps aligning the connectors, and makes soldering more easily.
