== Testing the PI Cluster Frame
Once the backplane are connected, perform the following test before applying power: 

- Remove all PI trays (PI nodes) from the chassis 
- With a Multimeter in continuity mode check for shorts on the back-plane. For example: start by testing between the pins of the XT60 connector
- Check each back-plane for shorts. 
- Next when no shorts are detected (or all are fixed) without any PI node in the cluster chassis, apply 5V to the cluster chassis
- Measure the voltage on each backplane 5V connector

When everything looks okey: 

- Use a lab power supply (if possible and limit the current to 600mA)
- Insert one PI tray into the chassis. 
- Apply power and see if the PI node starts without problems. 
- Measure the voltage on the other pins on the back-plane

Once everything is okey insert the second PI node, let it boot. And after each successfully power up of a node, insert the next PI node until the whole chassis is populated and all nodes are booted.
